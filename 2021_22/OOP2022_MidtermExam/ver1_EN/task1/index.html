<h1>Task 1 (6 points)</h1>
<p>Your task is to write classes that represent different aircrafts (<code>Aircraft</code>). It is necessary to implement the following aircrafts: <code>CameraDrone</code> and <code>Plane</code>.</p>
<p>Each aircraft has following immutable attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>model (<code>model</code>:<code>String</code>),</li>
<li>date of production (<code>dateProduced</code>:<code>String</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Camera drone</strong> additionally has a range (<code>range</code>:<code>int</code>) expressed in km (also immutable), and carries elements (e.g. sensors) and each of them has a quality values (<code>qualities</code>:<code>int[]</code>) expressed as a percentage (100-perfectly correct; 0-incorrect). See example.</p>
<p><strong>Plane</strong> also has a passenger capacity (<code>capacity</code>:<code>int</code>) and a list of the value of all engines (<code>motorsStatus</code>:<code>int[]</code>) expressed as a percentage (100-perfectly correct; 0-incorrect). See example.</p>
<p>For aircraft, you must define a public method that computes the status of the aircraft: <code>public abstract Status aircraftStatus()</code>, where Status is an enumeration that can take the following values: <code>FUNCTIONAL</code>, <code>NEED_CHECK</code>, <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of camera drones, the status is calculated as the average value of the quality of all elements. That is, if the average is in the range &lt;70,100], the drone is functional (<code>FUNCTIONAL</code>), [50, 70] the drone needs to be checked (<code>NEED_CHECK</code>), [0,50&gt; the drone is out of service (<code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>).</li>
<li>In the case of planes, if all engines have status of 100, the plane is functional (<code>FUNCTIONAL</code>), if at least 1 is below 100, a check is required (<code>NEED_CHECK</code>), and if at least 1 is below 80, the plane is out of service (<code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The camera drone is an unmanned aircraft and must implement the <code>Unmanned</code> interface, which has the <code>public double coverArea(Number height);</code> method. As parameter this method receives the flying height (km). As a result, the method returns the product of the range and the flying height. See example.</p>
<p>The <code>toString</code> method must also be rearranged to match the example.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write getters and setters for each attribute.</li>
<li>All classes and interfaces have <em>package private</em> visibility and are in <code>hr.fer.oop.zad1</code> package.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Usage example</em>:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-java">CameraDrone spanishCD = new CameraDrone(&quot;SP-121&quot;, &quot;1990-09-12&quot;, 1000, new int[]{100, 33});

System.out.println(spanishCD.toString());
System.out.println(&quot;The purpose of the drone is land photography and can cover an area of: &quot; + spanishCD.coverArea(5.0)); // flying height is 5km
System.out.println(spanishCD.aircraftStatus());

CameraDrone croatianCD = new CameraDrone(&quot;HR-200&quot;, &quot;2000-10-14&quot;, 1100, new int[]{100, 80, 90});

System.out.println(croatianCD.toString());
System.out.println(&quot;The purpose of the drone is land photography and can cover an area of: &quot; + croatianCD.coverArea(4.5)); // flying height is 4.5km
System.out.println(croatianCD.aircraftStatus());


Plane plane = new Plane(&quot;Airbus A 320-200&quot;, &quot;2001-03-04&quot;, 174, new int[] {100, 70, 95});
System.out.println(plane.toString());
System.out.println(plane.aircraftStatus());
plane.setMotorsStatus(new int[]{100, 100, 100});
System.out.println(plane.aircraftStatus());
</code></pre>
<p><em>Expected output</em>:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-sh">Aircraft model SP-121 is produced 1990-09-12 and has 2 elements.
The purpose of the drone is land photography and can cover an area of: 5000.0
NEED_CHECK
Aircraft model HR-200 is produced 2000-10-14 and has 3 elements.
The purpose of the drone is land photography and can cover an area of: 4950.0
FUNCTIONAL
Aircraft model Airbus A 320-200 is produced 2001-03-04 and has 3 motors and capacity of 174.
OUT_OF_SERVICE
FUNCTIONAL

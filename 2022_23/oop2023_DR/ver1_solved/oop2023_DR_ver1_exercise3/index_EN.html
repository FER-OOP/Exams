<p>It is necessary to implement the class <code>FileVisitorPasswordFinder</code> which implements the interface <code>FileVisitor&lt;Path&gt;</code> to visit given directory and its subdirectories. The class has one <code>String</code> attribute named <code>resultDirectoryPath</code> that is set within the constructor and its value cannot be changed later (but its retrieval must be enabled). Additionally, the class should implement the following functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in each directory you should find all <code>.txt</code> files that contain a string of characters <code>password</code> (which can also be inside another string of characters, e.g. <code>password:dd</code>), and copy them to the destination directory (<code>resultDirectoryPath</code>). At the same time, in the destination directory (<code>resultDirectoryPath</code>), for each directory that is visited, one additional <code>.txt</code> file with the same name as the visited directory should be created, and that should contain only those lines of <code>.txt</code> files in that directory containing the word <code>password</code>. If there are no such lines in a particular directory, it is not necessary to create its <code>.txt</code> file;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the name of each file in which the word <code>password</code> is found and its size in bytes should be printed to the standard output:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;file_name&gt; = &lt;size_in_bytes&gt;</p>
<p>Example of use:</p>
<p>If the implemented FileVisitor has the value of the <code>resultDirectoryPath</code> attribute set to <code>/res/oopIspit/</code> in the constructor, and it visits a directory that has the following structure and files of sizes visible in the same image:</p>
<p><img src="res/folderStruct.png" alt="Browsing folder structure" /></p>
<p>while the following files, among other lines, also contain the following lines with the word password:</p>
<p>a.txt</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code>password: blah blah
my password is a great password
</code></pre>
<p>b.txt</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code>password blah blah blah blah blah
</code></pre>
<p>e.txt</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code>password st19
</code></pre>
<p>it is necessary to create a file <code>pretrazivaniFolder.txt</code> in the <code>/res/oopIspit/</code> directory, which will have the following content after executing <code>Files.walkFileTree</code> method with the created visitor and the depicted folder given as attributes (the order of the lines is not important):</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code>password: blah blah
my password is a great password
password blah blah blah blah blah
</code></pre>
<p>and the file <code>folder.txt</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code>password st19
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to the above two files, the destination directory will also contain copies of the files a.txt, b.txt and e.txt</p>
<p>Also, the standard output will have the following lines printed out:
a.txt = 121
b.txt = 147
e.txt = 201</p>
<p>lines may differ, but end of each line should contain the output shown above.</p>
<p><strong>Additional note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is not allowed to use class <code>File</code>, but only <code>Path</code> and <code>java.nio</code> package.</li>
<li>Reading lines does not include &quot;\n&quot;.</li>
<li>All classes are in the `hr.fer.oop' package.</li>
<li>If a destination file is to be created in a directory that does not exist, it first must be created to avoid java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException.</li>
<li>Assume that there will be no case when directories or files have the same name, or the same size.</li>
</ul>

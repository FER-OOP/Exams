<p>In the assignment, an abstract class <code>Creature</code>, a concrete (non-abstract) class <code>Human</code>, and a class <code>Main</code> are given. The goal is to write concrete classes <code>Bee</code>, <code>Unicorn</code>, and <code>Dragon</code>, as well as the types <code>FlyingCreature</code> and <code>MagicalCreature</code> for which it is necessary to decide whether they should be interfaces or classes. Additionally, it is necessary to establish a class hierarchy and implement appropriate interfaces in the classes. All concrete classes (<code>Human</code>, <code>Bee</code>, <code>Unicorn</code>, and <code>Dragon</code>) have the class <code>Creature</code> as a superclass, but not necessarily as their direct superclass.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Classes <code>Creature</code> and <code>Human</code> must not be changed for correct scoring of the solution.</strong></p>
<p>Objects of type <code>Creature</code> possess energy (<code>energy</code>) of type <code>int</code> which is set when the object is created, can be decreased by performing appropriate actions, and increased by 10 by resting, i.e., calling the method <code>void rest()</code>. The current energy state can be retrieved by calling the getter <code>int getEnergy()</code>, but there is no <em>setter</em> for setting it.</p>
<p>Objects of type <code>Unicorn</code> and <code>Dragon</code> are magical creatures and therefore also of type <code>MagicalCreature</code>. Objects of type <code>MagicalCreature</code> possess power (<code>power</code>) of type <code>int</code> which is set when the object is created, can be decreased by performing magic, i.e., calling the method <code>void performMagic()</code>, and increased by 10 by resting, i.e., calling the method <code>void rest()</code>. The current power state can be retrieved by calling the getter <code>int getPower()</code>. Analogous to energy (<code>energy</code>), <strong>there must not be a setter for power (<code>power</code>)</strong>.</p>
<p>Every object of type <code>Bee</code> or <code>Dragon</code> is a flying creature of type <code>FlyingCreature</code>. Flying creatures spend energy by flying, i.e., calling the method <code>void fly()</code>.</p>
<p>Concrete classes have a single constructor, and an example of their invocation is shown in the snippet of the given <code>main</code> method in the <code>Main</code> class:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-java">Unicorn unicorn = new Unicorn(&quot;Sparkle&quot;, 100, 50); //name, energy, power
Dragon dragon = new Dragon(&quot;Smaug&quot;, 150, 70); //name, energy, power
Bee bee = new Bee(&quot;Buzzy&quot;, 30); //name, energy
Human human = new Human(&quot;Alice&quot;, 90); //name, energy
</code></pre>
<p>The following general methods can be called on any object of these 7 types (<code>Human</code>, <code>Bee</code>, <code>Unicorn</code>, <code>Dragon</code>, <code>Creature</code>, <code>FlyingCreature</code>, and <code>MagicalCreature</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>String getName()</code> - returns the name which is set in the constructor</li>
<li><code>int getEnergy()</code> - returns the current energy state</li>
<li><code>void rest()</code> - increases energy for objects of type <code>Creature</code> and additionally power for objects of type <code>MagicalCreature</code> as previously mentioned</li>
</ul>
<p>The following specific methods can also be called on objects of type <code>Human</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>void walk()</code> - decreases energy by 2</li>
<li><code>void work()</code> - decreases energy by 4</li>
</ul>
<p>The following specific methods can also be called on objects of type <code>Bee</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>void collectHoney()</code> - decreases energy by 2</li>
<li><code>void fly()</code> - decreases energy by 5</li>
</ul>
<p>The following specific methods can also be called on objects of type <code>Unicorn</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int getPower()</code> - returns the current power state</li>
<li><code>void performMagic()</code> - decreases energy by 2 and power by 4</li>
<li><code>void gallop()</code> - decreases energy by 3</li>
</ul>
<p>The following specific methods can also be called on objects of type <code>Dragon</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int getPower()</code> - returns the current power state</li>
<li><code>void performMagic()</code> - decreases energy by 1 and power by 3</li>
<li><code>void fly()</code> - decreases energy by 5</li>
</ul>
<p>The correct output of the given <code>main</code> method in the <code>Main</code> class should be:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-sh">    Alice has 90 energy upon creation
    Alice has 88 energy after walking
    Alice has 84 energy after working
    Alice has 94 energy after resting

    Buzzy has 30 energy upon creation
    Buzzy has 28 energy after collecting honey
    Buzzy has 23 energy after flying
    Buzzy has 33 energy after resting

    Sparkle has 100 energy and 50 power upon creation
    Sparkle has 97 energy and 50 power after galloping
    Sparkle has 95 energy and 46 power after performing magic
    Sparkle has 105 energy and 56 power after resting

    Smaug has 150 energy and 70 power upon creation
    Smaug has 145 energy and 70 power after flying
    Smaug has 144 energy and 67 power after performing magic
    Smaug has 154 energy and 77 power after resting
